/**
 * This package contains the abstract classes related to all the algorithms
 * used in RoCaWeb. 
 * 
 * Different libraries of Machine Learning are used in this project. Examples are:
 * <ul>
 * <li>Weka</li>
 * <li>ELKI</li>
 * <li>Lingpipe</li>
 * </ul>
 * 
 * Also, many algorithm have been developed related to: 
 * <ul>
 * <li>Sequence alignment</li>
 * <li>Statistical methods </li>
 *  <ul>
 *    <li>Chebychev </li>
 *    <li>KHI-squarre test </li>
 * </ul>
 * <li> Other machine learning algorithms</li>
 * </ul>
 * 
 * To uniform these libraries, we create common interfaces.
